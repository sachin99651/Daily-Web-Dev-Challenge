# Markdown to HTML Converter

A responsive, real-time web application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that converts Markdown syntax into structured HTML markup and provides a live preview. This project is part of my JavaScript learning journey and serves as **Project 1** for the freeCodeCamp certification.
